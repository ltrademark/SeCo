## ðŸ“¦ Development

---

## âœ… To Do
- finish implementing parameters
  - bind data from paramater to plugin
  - send data back to board and close parameter
- Fix Favourites (currently does not store to local storage)
- ~~implementing darkmode/theme support~~
- ~~Pinned or Favourites option~~
- ~~When placing icon, change position based on last icon placement~~
  - Though techincally fixed, the edge case to account for is when there is nothing selected, icons will always populate on 0 for x and y. Need context of shapes atop shapes.
- ~~reskin to flow more like Figma, and less like original application.~~
